# fine_tuning_LLaMA2
Fine-tuning a LLaMA 2 model for question answering involves adapting the pre-trained model to excel at responding accurately to questions. The model is trained on a dataset with question-answer pairs, allowing it to understand how to generate precise, context-aware answers. This fine-tuning process updates the model's weights, optimizing it for the specific task of answering questions. As a result, the model becomes more proficient in understanding queries and providing relevant, accurate responses in various domains.
